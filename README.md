# Serial-industrial-robotic-manipulator
This repository showcases my bachelor project: a 5-degree-of-freedom serial robotic manipulator inspired by industrial models from ABB, FANUC, and YASKAWA. Designed for modularity, scalability, and automation, the system aligns with Industry 4.0 standards and demonstrates advanced mechatronic integration.
